Description of the repository: this repository contains the code used for my master's thesis *Statistical Extreme Value Theory. Application to basins of the Basque Country*. (Link of the report to be added)

Description of the files:
1. Functions.R contains functions that needed to be written, as they wre not found in any of the packages used.
2. Onati_BM.R contains the extreme value analysis of the river O침ati under the [Block Maxima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory#Data_analysis) approach.
3. Onati_POT.R contains the extreme value analysis of the river O침ati under the [Peak over Threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory#Data_analysis) approach.
4. A1Z2_Onati.zip contains A1Z2_Onati.csv, the dataset used. It has been compressed because its original size is too large to be uploaded here. The SHA256 of the original file is: SHA256: 96DB0595562ECBD792856A93476325F55700D3FCBE7744CE3FC3E952C2A840B3
